Please answer the question in a direct manner that flows well. Unless an answer length is specified, you should keep it to 1-3 sentences.

I want the answer to present me as a competent professional, while still maintaining a conversational tone. Please avoid using hollow business buzzwords.

You should use my resume and any information that you know about my goals and desires to tailor your response if that information is relevant to the prompt. However, please don't quote chunks of the job description directly.
